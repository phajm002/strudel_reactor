# Strudel React App

This app contains features that allow users to update music in real-time using features such as a volume slider, instrument controls and changing the cpm of the music. The design of the website was carefully created using CSS and helps to show how the music is affected by these respective features.

## Controls

1. Volume slider - the volume slider has a blue dot which scales the music based on volume, moving the slider to the left will mute and make the music quiet, while moving the slider to the right will amplify the music.

2. CPM control - Entering in a cpm (such as 40, 50, etc.) will change the speed that each cycle plays, this can be seen in the audio visualizer where notes are sped up based on the entered cpm. This will update in real time.

3. Instrument control - Each instrument is listed with a checkbox, clicking on the checkbox will mute the instrument.

# Prompts used
The only prompt used in this assignment was to create "regex" expressions to allow for dynamic changing of cpm and instruments. After that, they were implemented individually.
